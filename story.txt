This is the story of the crispy system. X-Team 96 had a special computer they
were working on. This computer however got dropped in the fryer and burnt to a crisp
No one knew what to do, until...

They found that a programming competition was coming soon
And the reward was a fancy computer!
They were so excited...

They decided to work as hard as they could in CS400 in order to win the computer.
In the process, they got incredibly good at coding. Eventually they won the competition.
They also did very well in CS400, and it was all thanks to that computer that fell.
Or (as they like to call it) the "Crispy System."

The End
